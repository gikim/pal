* Merging template, for both child and adult datasets. Use this only as a reference, so create separate merge files for adult and child datasets

985d_Paper_Merge_GK1

* Child data, household, pbs, pfs, adult data

* template for both child and adult datasets
* create two different datasets
* you're doing the same for adult and child datasets
* perhaps you could merge it all together?

* There are 2520 observations in total
* Merging the household and adult datasets
* Merging with the household dataset, control for the location ID - that would do place fixed effects, clustered around time.
